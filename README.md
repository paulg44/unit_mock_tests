# unit_mock_tests

Basic vanilla JavaScript application. To test my knowledge of unit tests and mocks using Jest

## Components(so to speak)

- display items
  - sort items by category
- shopping basket
  - add items
- fake checkout page

## Extras

- option to sign in (auth)
- have a saved list

## CRUD Elements

- Display shop items
- Add item to basket
- Remove item from basket
- Edit quantity once in basket

## Tests

Frontend

- everything renders correctly
- items display
- sort option works
- buttons work and user interactions
- End to end test using Playwright
- Accessability. Use a framework?
- State management if needed

Backend

- Test models and database interactions to make sure they are defined. Use Mocha? or similar
- Test controllers logic to handle response and requests
- Mock external databases if there are any
- User auth
- Test intergration between different components like controllers, database and server (Mock?)
- Test for SQL injection (security)

## Random car thought 
Could, or should, I make the items going into the basket and object? So I can access things easier, make the total price easier etc by getting stuff from an id???
